/*
Package luar provides a convenient interface between Lua and Go.

It uses Alessandro Arzilli's golua (https://github.com/vxcontrol/golua).

Most Go values can be passed to Lua: basic types, strings, complex numbers,
user-defined types, pointers, composite types, functions, channels, etc.
Conversely, most Lua values can be converted to Go values.

Composite types are processed recursively.

Methods can be called on user-defined types. These methods will be callable
using _dot-notation_ rather than colon notation.

Arrays, slices, maps and structs can be copied as tables, or alternatively
passed over as Lua proxy objects which can be naturally indexed.

In the case of structs and string maps, fields have priority over methods. Use
'luar.method(<value>, <method>)(<params>...)' to call shadowed methods.

Unexported struct fields are ignored. The "lua" tag is used to match fields in
struct conversion.

You may pass a Lua table to an imported Go function; if the table is
'array-like' then it is converted to a Go slice; if it is 'map-like' then it
is converted to a Go map.

Pointer values encode as the value pointed to when unproxified.

Usual operators (arithmetic, string concatenation, pairs/ipairs, etc.) work on
proxies too. The type of the result depends on the type of the operands. The
rules are as follows:

- If the operands are of the same type, use this type.

- If one type is a Lua number, use the other, user-defined type.

- If the types are different and not Lua numbers, convert to a complex proxy, a
Lua number, or a Lua string according to the result kind.


Channels

Channel proxies can be manipulated with the following methods:

- close(): Close the channel.

- recv() value: Fetch and return a value from the channel.

- send(x value): Send a value in the channel.


Complex numbers

Complex proxies can be manipulated with the following attributes:

- real: The real part.

- imag: The imaginary part.


Slices

Slice proxies can be manipulated with the following methods/attributes:

- append(x ...value) sliceProxy: Append the elements and return the new
slice. The elements must be convertible to the slice element type.

- cap: The capacity of the slice.

- slice(i, j integer) sliceProxy: Return the sub-slice that ranges from 'i' to 'j'
excluded, starting from 1.


Strings

String proxies can be browsed rune by rune with the pairs/ipairs functions.
These runes are encoded as strings in Lua.

Indexing a string proxy (starting from 1) will return the corresponding byte as
a Lua string.

String proxies can be manipulated with the following method:

- slice(i, j integer) sliceProxy: Return the sub-string that ranges from 'i' to 'j'
excluded, starting from 1.
